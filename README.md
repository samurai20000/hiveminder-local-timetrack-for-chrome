## Note
Original script is created by typester. http://github.com/typester/hiveminder-local-timetrack

This script set is for adding local time tracking feature to [Hiveminder](http://hiveminder.com/).

Yeah, I know Hiveminder supports time tracking. But it doesn't work at offline.
I sometimes place myself at offline, because working at online has a number of temptations, twitter/irc/im and so on.. That's why I want this.

## Features

* Simple time tracking
* Enable webkitnotification instead of jGrowl
* Notify current tasks every 10 minutes (it probably get you back to work ;)
* If you don't work timetracking, notify "What are you doing now?" every 10 minutes.
* Save elapsed time on localStorage.

## Current issues

* Currently it doesn't save elapsed time, so you lost it when reload page.
* And also doesn't save it to official time record.

## How to use
* install extension. https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hkleomkjlbhamikmcfnagbaafmdoecba
* open Hiveminder.com
* click request Permission
